## Configuring the lang.yml file
There is a full, & color-coded version of the lang.yml [here](https://hasteb.in/lanenuwe.vbs).
The base colors are gray (&7) and red (&c), giving it a cool, PVP-like feeling about it. To change these color codes, doing `CMD/CNTRL + F` and typing in `&c/&7` should show you all the positions in the file. We suggest you use Sublime when editing documents, as it has a neat tool called **Find All** which you use to replace the color codes with the ones you desire.

**NOTE:** In a recent update, the `lang.yml` has been changed to color codes and not <> variables. This is a template, not the official file.
