### Bigger f map
The f map is now bigger by default. This has always been configurable in the `Conf.json`, but the new default values are in line with what people consider "large f map".

Setting | Old Default | New Default
--- | --- | ---
mapHeight | 8 | 17
mapWidth | 39 | 49

**Command**
* `/f mapheight <value>` - set your /f map height
* `/f mapheight` - show your current map height
* Permission: `factions.mapheight`

**New default** `/f map`
