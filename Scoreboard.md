### Enabling the scoreboard
You might've tried doing /f sb and it saying "The scoreboard is not enabled!", well here's a guide to help you with that.

In the config.yml, go to the `Scoreboard` section. In there, there will be two parts: F-info and the default scoreboard. The f-info variable is when you walk into a faction's territory, it will show you information about that faction. You can set how long it stays when entering in the `expiration` section.

The other variable is the default scoreboard. This will constantly show. It has an option to enable `default prefixes`, which in turn changes the tablist showing your faction and relation to that faction.
